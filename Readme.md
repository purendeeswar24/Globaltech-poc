# AI-Powered Document Understanding and Search

This project leverages a suite of powerful Python libraries to build an AI-driven system for processing documents, extracting information, and enabling intelligent search capabilities.

## Core Components and Their Roles:

Here's a breakdown of the key libraries used and their specific applications within this project:
1️⃣ pdfplumber

Purpose: Extracts structured content (text, tables, and metadata) from PDF files.

Use in your project:

If your project involves processing PDFs (like invoices, reports, or scanned documents), pdfplumber lets you read text, extract tables, and even locate text positions.

Example: Parsing vendor data PDFs to convert into structured tables for AI processing.

2️⃣ Pillow

Purpose: Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork for image processing.

Use in your project:

Handles images inside PDFs or standalone images.

Resize, crop, convert formats, annotate, or preprocess images before feeding into a model.

Example: Preprocessing scanned PDFs or product images for AI analysis.

3️⃣ sentence-transformers

Purpose: Embedding generation for sentences, paragraphs, or documents using pretrained transformer models.

Use in your project:

Convert textual data into vector representations for semantic search, similarity matching, or recommendation.

Example:

Matching user queries to vendor descriptions.

Finding similar documents or FAQs from your database.

4️⃣ faiss-cpu

(I assume you mean FAISS CPU version)

Purpose: Efficient similarity search and clustering of high-dimensional vectors.

Use in your project:

Works with embeddings from sentence-transformers.

Enables fast vector search to find the most relevant results.

Example:

User searches “best CRM vendor,” FAISS finds the top 5 matching vendors from your embeddings.

5️⃣ Flask

Purpose: Lightweight Python web framework for building APIs or web apps.

Use in your project:

Wrap your AI logic (PDF processing, embeddings, vector search) into REST APIs.

Example:

User uploads PDF → Flask API extracts text → generates embeddings → searches FAISS → returns top vendor matches.

✅ Workflow Example Combining All:

User uploads a PDF via a Flask web app.

pdfplumber extracts text and tables.

Pillow processes any images in the PDF.

sentence-transformers generates embeddings of extracted text.

faiss-cpu finds similar vendors or matches in your database.

Flask returns results to the user interface.
